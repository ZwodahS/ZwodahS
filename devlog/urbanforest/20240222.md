# 0.0.4 (2024/02/22)
## The game
- Reworked the whole game to not have a deck hand etc, and just use cooldown instead.

## Thoughts
Feels better but still feels like something is missing. I am not sure what.

Although I like the cooldown and charges aspect, the game don't hold me.
A lot of the placement becomes trivial because I can just spam them.
The starting part of the game may also become stagnant after a few games.

Not sure if this is due to the balance of the game or just the core ideas.

I think I want to add more restriction on placement.

I don't like the mid game and end game of this iteration.
I don't like the early game of the previous iteration.

## Next things to do try
I am thinking, what if we just make all cards single use,
then use ideas to open packs and choose 3 out of 10 or something like that.

We are still limited by cash, but also at the same time limited by charges

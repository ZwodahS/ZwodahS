# 0.0.3 (2024/02/18)
## The game
- Added Terrain Resource. Gives passive effect, and also a unique building that can be placed on top.
- Added Building Block.
- Voters give -4 Comfort.

## Thoughts
With terrain resource, there are a lot more consideration for where you start building.
This is actually quite interesting.

Knowledge is actually too much now. Even with a single school I have more knowledge than necessary.

Blocks also seems hard to build. Maybe the requirement can drop slightly.

T2 buildings can shift down to 15 cash potentially.

Terrain type become very suffocating if you don't know what you are doing.

## Next things to do
Currently too hard to play the game without UX and information QOL.
Will probably do that next.

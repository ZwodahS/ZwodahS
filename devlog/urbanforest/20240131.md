# 0.0.1 (2024/01/31)
## The game
- 5 different stats, and 3 different resources

- Population, every 10 gives you a reward
- Nature, give +comfort or +commerce
- Cash, used to build buildings. Commerce gives gold/turn
- Idea, used to research tech. Knowledge gives idea/turn
- Happiness, not used. when 0 = gameover. Comfort give happiness/turn.

- research tree to research technology.
- transform card with cash

## Thoughts
Research then transform feels weird. I think I will probably remove the research and just stick to transform.
Placement is interesting once I remove some of the terrain requirement. So I think I will lean into it ?
If we have things like lumbermill that are based on adjacency, together with restrictive terrain, I think the decision space will be more interesting.
Eventually I will have block(buildings that share a type form a block), which will make the placement even more interesting.
More Terrain type will be more interesting as well.

There are also other thoughts on balance.

Population reward every 10 is too static.
I am not respecting how much population gain will scale later on.
Probably will have to change it such that the requirement will be
5 / 10 / 20

Nature effect is also boring. I think I want more interesting nature effect that are more conditional than raw stats
Like +1 Commerce to all Commercial building.
Or
Commerce + 5 if there are 5 commercial building.
Or
Commerce + 1 for 1 turn when you build a commercial building.

Voters
I think having many voters makes it too generic and a lot of the criteria will naturally be completed.
I think it will be more interesting to make it harder, but reduce the number of voter groups to 6.
In this case, 3 of them will be hidden behind population threshold.
Another idea is to add "problems" to the first 3 voters.
It will be like a negative effect that they add after each year, first one after the first 12 turns, next at 24 turns etc.
Once you "complete" their criteria, the negative effect will be removed.

## Next things to try
- Remove Research tree, just use a "transform grid" that uses idea to convert cards instead.
- Population rewards shift to 5/10/20 to scale up as it goes.
- More conditional buildings.
- Drop the number of voters from 12 -> 6, but make criteria harder. Will not do problematic voters next, will KIV that to later.

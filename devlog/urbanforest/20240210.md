# 0.0.2 (2024/02/10)
## The game
- Removed Research tree. This adds little except too much complexity
- Use idea to add/remove cards. Cost increased after each use (shared).
- Voters now give -3 Comfort if you have not complete their requirement.
- Voters now start at 0 unlocked.
- Population now gives gifts (relic) instead of fixed rewards.
- Nature effect changed slightly.

## Thoughts
Okay without the research tree the complexity of the game drop significantly.
Balance is too easy right now, that can be easily tweaked.

The change to use relic for population is pretty good.
Even with the simple relics, they already added some placement consideration.
I guess there is a reason why all deckbuilders have relics.

The voters unlocking together with relic means that negative comfort for relic would be a push and pull.

## Next things to try.
Will start balancing some numbers to see if I can get a challenging experience soon.
Will probably add gameover(0 happiness) and victory next.
Goal is to make the hardest game mode first, then make it easier later.

There are 2 more mechanics that I will definitely want to add Building Block and Terrain Resource.
Not sure which one I will add next, probably will have to see which one is easier.
